> Agents, skills, and rules for architects, designers, and AEC professionals — use with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

**Architecture Studio** teaches Claude architecture-specific workflows — site analysis, zoning, space programming, specifications, materials research, sustainability, and presentations.

**7 agents**, **39 skills**, **7 rules**, and **3 hooks** across **10 plugins**. Built by [ALPA](https://alpa.llc).

```

**Agents** orchestrate skills across plugins — they assess your input, choose a path, and exercise judgment; each ships inside the plugin it orchestrates and registers as a native Claude Code subagent. **Skills** are single-purpose tools invoked with a slash command. **Rules** are cross-cutting conventions (two hook-enforced, five advisory). **Hooks** are event-driven automations that ship with the Dispatcher plugin and register automatically. Skills are grouped into **plugins** (installable bundles organized by project lifecycle).

## Quick Start

### Install

**Claude Desktop:** Open **Customize** → **Browse plugins** → **+** → **Add marketplace from GitHub** → enter `AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects`

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
claude plugin install 01-site-planning@skills-for-architects
```

### Use

Type `/studio` followed by what you need. The router reads your request and hands off to the right agent or skill.

```
/studio task chair, mesh back, under $800
/studio 123 Main St, Brooklyn NY
/studio I need a space program for 200 people
/studio parse this EPD
```

Type `/skills` for the full menu. Or call any skill directly by name (e.g. `/environmental-analysis 123 Main St`).

## Agents

Agents are the orchestration layer. Describe your task — the agent decides which skills to call, in what order, and what judgment to apply.

| Agent | Domain | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [site-planner](./plugins/01-site-planning/agents/site-planner.md) | Site Planning | Runs all site research in parallel, synthesizes a unified brief with opportunities and constraints |
| [nyc-zoning-expert](./plugins/02-zoning-analysis/agents/nyc-zoning-expert.md) | Due Diligence + Zoning | Full NYC property and zoning analysis — due diligence, buildable envelope, 3D visualization |
| [workplace-strategist](./plugins/03-programming/agents/workplace-strategist.md) | Programming | Translates headcount and work style into space programs — occupancy compliance, zone allocation, room schedules |
| [product-and-materials-researcher](./plugins/06-materials-research/agents/product-and-materials-researcher.md) | Materials Research | Finds products from a brief, extracts specs from URLs/PDFs, tags and classifies, finds alternatives |
| [ffe-designer](./plugins/06-materials-research/agents/ffe-designer.md) | FF&E Design | Builds clean schedules from messy inputs, composes room packages, runs QA, exports to dealer formats |
| [sustainability-specialist](./plugins/05-sustainability/agents/sustainability-specialist.md) | Sustainability | Evaluates environmental impact — finds EPDs, compares GWP, checks LEED eligibility, writes spec thresholds |
| [brand-manager](./plugins/07-presentations/agents/brand-manager.md) | Presentations | Owns visual identity — builds decks, creates palettes, QAs deliverables for presentation readiness |

See the [agents index](./agents/README.md) for full workflows and handoff logic.

## Rules

Cross-cutting conventions every skill is written against. Two are hook-enforced (professional-disclaimer, csi-formatting); the other five are advisory references — see [rules/](./rules) for the honest breakdown.

| Rule | What it governs |
|------|-----------------|
| [units-and-measurements](./rules/units-and-measurements.md) | Imperial/metric, area types (GSF/USF/RSF), dimensions |
| [code-citations](./rules/code-citations.md) | Building code references, edition years, jurisdiction awareness |
| [professional-disclaimer](./rules/professional-disclaimer.md) | Disclaimer language, what AI outputs can and cannot claim |
| [csi-formatting](./rules/csi-formatting.md) | MasterFormat 2018 section numbers, three-part structure |
| [terminology](./rules/terminology.md) | AEC standard terms, abbreviations, material names |
| [output-formatting](./rules/output-formatting.md) | Tables, source attribution, file naming, list structure |
| [transparency](./rules/transparency.md) | Show your work — link sources, expose inputs, make outputs verifiable |

## Hooks

Event-driven automations — they ship with the [Dispatcher plugin](./plugins/08-dispatcher) and register automatically when it's enabled. No settings merge needed.

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [post-write-disclaimer-check](./plugins/08-dispatcher/hooks/post-write-disclaimer-check.sh) | After Write | Warns if regulatory output is missing the professional disclaimer |
| [post-output-metadata](./plugins/08-dispatcher/hooks/post-output-metadata.sh) | After Write | Stamps markdown reports with YAML front matter |
| [pre-commit-spec-lint](./plugins/08-dispatcher/hooks/pre-commit-spec-lint.sh) | Before git commit | Flags malformed CSI section numbers |

See the [hooks directory](./plugins/08-dispatcher/hooks) for details and customization.

## Contributing

Want to add a skill for the built environment?

1. **Fork** this repository
2. Create your skill in the appropriate plugin folder (or propose a new plugin)
3. Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` with instructions and domain knowledge, a `README.md`, and any supporting data files
4. Open a **pull request** — describe what the skill does, how you tested it, and sample output

For the full conventions we apply across all our plugins (naming, layout, dispatcher pattern, versioning, hard rules from real bugs), read [PATTERNS.md](./PATTERNS.md). Release history lives in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).
