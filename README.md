> Agents, skills, and rules for architects, designers, and AEC professionals — use with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

**Architecture Studio** teaches Claude architecture-specific workflows — site analysis, zoning, space programming, specifications, materials research, sustainability, and presentations.

**7 agents**, **35 skills**, **7 rules**, and **3 hooks** across **9 plugins**. Built by [ALPA](https://alpa.llc).

**Agents** orchestrate skills across plugins — they assess your input, choose a path, and exercise judgment. **Skills** are single-purpose tools invoked with a slash command. **Rules** govern every output. **Hooks** are event-driven automations. Skills are grouped into **plugins** (installable bundles organized by project lifecycle).

## Quick Start

### Install

**Claude Desktop:** Open **Customize** → **Browse plugins** → **+** → **Add marketplace from GitHub** → enter `AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects`

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
claude plugin install 01-site-planning@skills-for-architects
```

### Use

Type `/studio` followed by what you need. The router reads your request and hands off to the right agent or skill.

```
/studio task chair, mesh back, under $800
/studio 123 Main St, Brooklyn NY
/studio I need a space program for 200 people
/studio parse this EPD
```

Type `/skills` for the full menu. Or call any skill directly by name (e.g. `/environmental-analysis 123 Main St`).

## Agents

Agents are the orchestration layer. Describe your task — the agent decides which skills to call, in what order, and what judgment to apply.

| Agent | Domain | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [site-planner](./agents/site-planner.md) | Site Planning | Runs all site research in parallel, synthesizes a unified brief with opportunities and constraints |
| [nyc-zoning-expert](./agents/nyc-zoning-expert.md) | Due Diligence + Zoning | Full NYC property and zoning analysis — due diligence, buildable envelope, 3D visualization |
| [workplace-strategist](./agents/workplace-strategist.md) | Programming | Translates headcount and work style into space programs — occupancy compliance, zone allocation, room schedules |
| [product-and-materials-researcher](./agents/product-and-materials-researcher.md) | Materials Research | Finds products from a brief, extracts specs from URLs/PDFs, tags and classifies, finds alternatives |
| [ffe-designer](./agents/ffe-designer.md) | FF&E Design | Builds clean schedules from messy inputs, composes room packages, runs QA, exports to dealer formats |
| [sustainability-specialist](./agents/sustainability-specialist.md) | Sustainability | Evaluates environmental impact — finds EPDs, compares GWP, checks LEED eligibility, writes spec thresholds |
| [brand-manager](./agents/brand-manager.md) | Presentations | Owns visual identity — builds decks, creates palettes, QAs deliverables for presentation readiness |

See the [agents directory](./agents) for full workflows and handoff logic.
