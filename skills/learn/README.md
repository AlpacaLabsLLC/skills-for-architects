# /learn

A resumable, hands-on course teaching architects how to use Claude Code. Six modules, most ~15–20 minutes, each built around an exercise on the bundled sandbox project — a fictional Brooklyn art museum planning a rooftop expansion (`sandbox/art-museum/`, six deliberately messy files).

## Usage

```
/learn        → first run: sets up the practice folder and starts Module 0
/learn        → any later run: reads PROGRESS.md and resumes where you left off
```

Progress is tracked in `PROGRESS.md` in the practice folder (default `~/claude-code-101`). Delete it to restart the course.

On the first session after installing the plugin, a welcome hook confirms the install and offers the course unprompted.

## Design

- **Do, then explain** — the learner's hands are on the keyboard within a few sentences of any teach beat.
- **The tutor never does the exercise for them** — it guides and reviews.
- **Studio analogies throughout** — `CLAUDE.md` is the standards binder, skills are laminated procedures, markdown is plain paper.
- **Three ideas thread the course**: work stays local (files never leave the machine except what's asked about), Architecture Studio is an open-source harness on Claude Code (fork it, make it your own), and memory is plain files you can read.
- **Module 6 closes with real work** — a source-check drill (trace claims to their lines, then ask about what the document *doesn't* say), a short professional checklist (firm policy, low-stakes, work on a copy — recommended, never imposed), and one real task end to end. Data privacy is taught back in Module 2, where consent is taught. The learner can quit /learn at any moment, no questions asked.
- The sandbox files are engineered: the CSV has a duplicate row, mixed units, and a TBD; `IMG_4032.txt` is a mislabeled voice memo; `Scan_001.txt` is a regulatory excerpt with enough specifics to make an invented claim plausible — and deliberate silences to plant it in.

An advanced track — bigger jobs, plan mode, subagents, skill authorship in depth, running the office skill library — is planned as a follow-on course; the `examples/` skills below are its precedent material.

## Bundled material

| Directory | Used in | Contents |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `sandbox/` | Modules 1–6 | The fictional Greenpoint Museum of Art — six deliberately messy files with engineered flaws |
| `templates/` | Module 3 | `office-CLAUDE.md`, a starter standards binder distilled from the Architecture Studio rules |
| `examples/` | Advanced track (planned) | Three finished skills to study and modify: `/ascii-name`, `/clean-downloads`, `/tasks` |
